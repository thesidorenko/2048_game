# 2048 Game
A classic sliding puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile. Test your strategic thinking and enjoy the addictive gameplay as you slide tiles in four directions to merge identical numbers.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5: Provides the structure for the game interface, including the game board and UI elements.
- SCSS: A preprocessor scripting language for CSS, offering features like variables and nesting for improved code organization.
- JavaScript: Powers the game's logic and interactivity, enabling tile movements, merging, and game state management
